        // Create a guessing game. Start by generating a random number between 1 and 100. Then ask the user to guess the number. If the user enters a higher number, it should display the following text “DOWN”.
        // Otherwise, it must indicate: "UP". If the user gets it right, he should
        // see the message “CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GUESSED IT!”.

        // -1 if the attempt is LOWER than the number initially generated
        // 1 if the attempt is HIGHER than the number initially generated
        // 0 if the attempt is EQUAL to the number initially generated
        // Make the game more interesting and give the player just 5 tries. If the
        // user reaches the limit, he should see: “PATIENCE, PLEASE PLAY AGAIN!”.
